# **TSB Car Share Scheme**
## PP-1-S2-2021-FRI1030PM-Group1

## About
This program was made by RMIT students for a Further Programming Capstone project, and is based on a car sharing app like Go-Get

The contributors were:
- Sulaiman Dayoub
- Taylor Franklin
- Cass Ilangantileke
- Luke Kampen
- Michael Vella

### Frameworks
The frameworks and APIs that we used were:

- MySQL for database management
- Stripe for payments
- Composer for emails
- Google Maps for map functions

## Running TSB on a _Local Machine_
In order to run the program on a local machine, a user will need to download and use XAMPP, download composer and add:
```
{
    
    "require": {
        "phpmailer/phpmailer": "^6.5",
        "stripe/stripe-php": "^7.97"
    }
}
```
to the composer.json file, and run it. The user will also need to add a carshare databse into their PHPMyAdmin when XAMPP is running.

## Use
In order to use the program, the user needs to be logged in, with either a pre-existing account or by creating one, and then by clicking on the relevant headings in order to achieve the desired outcome.
